    "The ABO blood group system consists of four different blood groups, which describe whether an individual's red blood cells carry the A antigen, B antigen, both, or neither. The ABO gene has three alleles: ${I}^{A}$, ${I}^{B}$, and \\textit{i}. The \\textit{i} allele is recessive to both ${I}^{A}$ and ${I}^{B}$, while the ${I}^{A}$ and ${I}^{B}$ allels are codominant. Individuals homozygous for the \\textit{i} allele are known as blood group O, with neither A nor B antigens. this is summarized in the following table:\n",
