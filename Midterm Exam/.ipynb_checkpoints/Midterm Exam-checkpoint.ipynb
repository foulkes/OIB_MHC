    "The human gastrointestinal system is home to a vast number of microbial cells; the term \"human microbiome\" refers specifically to the full collection of genes of all microbes in this community. Gut microbial communities are known to influence host health or disease susceptibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will examine data adapted from a study investigating the role of the microbiome in the development of colon cancer (Kostic, Aleksandar D., et al., 2012, Genomic analysis identifies association of *Fusobacterium* with colorectal carcinoma. Genome Research 22: 292-298.) The data are read into `R` using the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original study examined cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissue collected from colon cancer patients living in Spain, Vietnam, and the United States. Recorded measurements include information about the patient (e.g. age, gender) and about the microbes found in the colon. When the bacteria are measured in this setting, the data for each species (i.e., for each \"bug\") are recorded as the frequency of that species detected divided by the total number of bacteria from all species. Thus, the values represent the proportion of bacteria present belonging to that particular species; this type of data is often referred to as relative abundance data, or abundance data. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Among these 100 bacteria, which seem to have unexpectedly large or small levels of mean relative abundance? In other words, which bacteria have a mean relative abundance that is an outlier?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The data you will work with includes abundance data for only the cancer tissue samples from each patient. The dataset pheno.abundance includes the following information for each patient:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Age`: age at diagnosis, in years\n",
    "  - `Gender`: gender, coded as Male or Female\n",
    "  - `Stage`: coded 1-4.  Larger values of Stage indicate cancer that is harder to treat\n",
    "  - `bug1` to `bug100`: relative abundance for each bacteria (i.e., \"bug\") identified in the tumor samples. The numbers represent the proportion of the total number of bacteria per sample that were identified as a particular type; for example, a value of 0.05 in `bug1` for a patient indicates that 5% of the gut bacteria in that patient were of type `bug1`.(DNA sequencing was used to identify the species of each bug type, but for simplicity, we have not included that information.)
