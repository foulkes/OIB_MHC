Suppose that the prevalence of a disease is very low, and extremely close to 0; the numerator would also be close to 0, causing PPV to be low. In the other direction, if prevalence is very high (almost 1), then the second term in the denominator that contains *(1 - prevalence)* essentially disappears, and the numerator divided by the denominator will be very high (almost 1). \n",

When prevalence increases, even though both the numerator and denominator are increasing from $[prev \\times sensitivity]$, the denominator is also decreasing from $[(1-prev) \\times (1-specificity)]$ decreasing (since as prevalence increases, the quantity $(1 - prev)$ decreases). Since sensitivity and specificity are constant, increasing prevalence has the effect of increasing the number of true positives (left term) and decreasing the number of false positives (right term). PPV increases when the number of true positives increases.\n",

    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:navy\"> The relationship between PPV and prevalence has very important implications in breast cancer and in screening populations for diseases. A paper published on February 9, 2017 in *Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention* suggests that women who experience a false positive mammogram are less likely to return for their regularly scheduled mammogram than women who receive a true negative.  False positives are usually confirmed with a biopsy, and this unpleasant experience seems to have a negative influence on health behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:navy\"> More generally, small values of PPV in diseases with low prevalence make it impractical and sometimes unethical to screen for diseases with low prevalence.  In the early days of the HIV epidemic in the US, there was considerable support for screening everyone for HIV.  The epidemic was real, but the number of HIV+ individuals in the US was very small, and false positive tests might have led to the loss of employment or other stigma.  Fortunately, mass screening was never implemented.  It is possible to *increase* prevalence by restricting the screened population to individuals at high risk for a disease, because the prevalence in the high risk population would be higher. Viewed this way, prevalence is a conditional probability of disease, given membership in a high risk population.\n"

    "d) Suppose that two new mammogram imaging technologies have been developed which can improve the PPV associated with mammograms; one improves sensitivity to 99% (but specificity remains at 95%), while the other improves specificity to 99% (while sensitivity remains at 85%). Which technology offers a higher increase in PPV? Explain why."

    "\n",
    "The technology that raises specificity to 99% offers a higher increase. For example, see the below code that tests how PPV changes for the 70 - 80 age group, as compared to the current PPV of 0.403; while raising sensitivity only increases PPV to 0.440, raising specificity increases PPV to 0.771. Since prevalence of the disease only ranges between less than 1% to at most $\\sim$ 4%, most of the people tested do not have breast cancer. This implies that the low PPV is largely due to the high number of false positives. This value is related to the specificity. If specificity increases, this increases the number of true negatives and decreases the number of false positives. Increasing sensitivity can potentially increase the number of true positives detected and raise PPV, but this does not have as strong an effect.\n"
