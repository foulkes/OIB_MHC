    "In the first exercise of Unit 4 (Sampling from a Population), the goal was to compare point estimates of mean weight, $\\overline{x}_{weight}$, to the population parameter, $\\mu_{weight}$. In this exercise, instead of calculating point estimates from samples, we will calculate interval estimates, i.e. **confidence intervals**. A confidence interval gives a plausible range of values for a parameter and is centered at the point estimate. \n",

How do interval estimates of mean weight, $(\\overline{x}_{weight} - m, \\text{ } \\overline{x}_{weight} + m)$, calculated from random samples compare to the population parameter, $\\mu_{weight}$?\n",
