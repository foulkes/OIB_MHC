    "d) Epidemiologists sometimes use a statistic called relative risk. In this context, relative risk is the ratio of the proportion of smokers with stenosis to the proportion of non-smokers with stenosis. Relative risks greater than 1 indicate that smokers are at a higher risk for aortic stenosis than non-smokers, because, among smokers, a higher proportion of them will suffer from stenosis than the proportion among non-smokers.\n",

    "The interpretation of relative risk is a bit subtle. Suppose, for example, that among men with high cholesterol, 30% develop heart disease, while among men with low cholesterol, 24% develop heart disease. The relative risk of heart disease, comparing high versus low cholesterol, is 0.30/0.24 = 1.25. Epidemiologists would say that high cholesterol is associated with a 25% increase in the probability of heart disease. Relative risks of 1.2 or higher are generally considered cause for alarm.\n",
