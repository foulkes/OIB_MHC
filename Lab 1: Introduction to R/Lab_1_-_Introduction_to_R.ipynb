    "R comes with some basic default functions that can read in data, but they're not very useful.  Instead, we will use functions in the `readr` package for R.  A **package** is a group of extra functions that don't come with R by default, but can be used to extend R's functionality.  The `readr` package includes functions that can read in a variety of different types of data files.  R packages are stored in a **library**.  We can load the `readr` package, and make the functions it provides for reading data available to use, with the first command in the next cell (go ahead and run these commands now):"

    "Before we get too much further, take a careful look at the output of the `head` command above.  I would like to draw your attention to two important points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are a bunch of `NA` values in this data set!  In R an `NA` represents missing data.  Some of these missing values \"make sense\" -- for example, the `PregnantNow` variable is missing for all of the male respondents in the data set.  Also, we don't have any information about the `Education` level or `MaritalStatus` of the first or the fifth respondent -- but notice that thes participants were aged 14 and 5, respectively.  However, if we plan to do an analysis involving variables with missing values, we need to think about **why** those responses are missing, and **whether that missing data affects the validity of our analysis**.  In some cases, it's possible to deal with missing data like this, but we will not discuss those methods much in this class.\n",
    "2. Let's think carefully about the categorical variables in this data set.  For some of these variables, like `MaritalStatus` and `PregnantNow`, it seems clear that there are distinct categories for that variable and every respondent will fall neatly into exactly one of those categories.  However, for other variables, like `Gender` and `Race`, it is less clear that there are really distinct categories, or that the categories used in this data set provide a full view of those variables.  The people collecting the data have made a decision about the possible values of those variables, and determined that every subject will be assigned to exactly one category value.  People engaged in other data collection projects have made different decisions, for example allowing a larger and more refined set of categories and/or allowing each person to identify with multiple categories.  It is important to recognize that these **data collection decisions affect the sorts of questions that it is possible to ask and answer** with this data set.  Finally, others of these categorical variables, like `HHIncome` and `Diabetes` can be viewed as a coarsening of an underlying continuous variable.  For example, in this data set we are only told a range of values for the household income, not the exact income level.  Again, this affects what we can do with the data.\n",
