    "\n",
    " * The `rbinom` *function* simulates flipping a coin 16 times and counts the number of heads that came up.  The name of this function describes the fact that it **r**andomly generates values from a **binom**ial distribution.  The binomial distribution is just the name statisticians have given to describe how often different numbers of heads come up when you flip a coin a certain number of times.  We'll talk about this distribution more later in the class.\n",
    " \n",
    " * The `rbinom` function has three *arguments*, describing how the coin flipping should be done:\n",
    "   1. `n` tells `R` how many times to repeat the experiment (how many times we ask 16 babies to choose a toy -- just once for now)\n",
    "   2. `size` tells `R` how many babies are included in each run of the experiment -- 16\n",
    "   3. `prob` tells `R` how likely each baby is to choose the friendly toy -- we set this to 0.5 because we're working under the null model where babies are equally likely to choose either toy.\n",
    "\n",
    " * We store the results of this simulation in a *variable* called `experiment_results`.  The `<-` (a less than symbol followed by a minus sign) is called the *assignment operator*.  It tells `R`, \"take the result of the computation on the right and store it in the variable on the left\".\n",
    "\n",
    " * All of that happened in just the first line of code!  In the second line we look at the results of the experiment by seeing what was stored in the `experiment_results` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Repeating the experiment 1000 times\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of using `R` was to make it easy to repeat the simulation many times.  In the next code cell, I have modified the code you ran above to perform 1000 simulations of the experiment, all under the null model that infants have no preference for either toy.  Go ahead and run the code in the next cell:"

Again, we'll discuss this in much more detail next class!\n",
