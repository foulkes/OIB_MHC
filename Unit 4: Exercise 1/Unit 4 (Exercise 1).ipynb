    "This exercise uses data from the Youth Risk Factor Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), a yearly survey conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control to measure health-related activity in high-school aged youth. The dataset \\texttt{yrbss} in the OIBioStat package contains responses from the 13,572 participants in 2013 for a subset of the variables included in the complete survey data. \n",

    "Variables in the dataset include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - age: age in years\n",

    "  - grade: grade in high school (9-12)\n",

    "  - height: height, in meters (1 m = 3.28 ft)\n",

    "  - weight: weight, in kilograms (1 kg = 2.2 lbs)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - helmet.12m: frequency that the student wore a helmet while biking in the last 12 months, either always, most of time, sometimes, rarely, never, or did not ride\n",

    "  - physically.active.7d: number of days physically active for 60+ minutes in the last 7 days\n",
